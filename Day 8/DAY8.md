# Exercise 1 - Paint Area Calculator
- Instructions:<br>
The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.<br>
number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.

- Input:<br>
height = 3<br>
width = 9

- Output:<br>
You'll need 6 cans of paint.

- Code:
```py
import math

def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    cans = (height * width) / cover
    print(f"You'll need {math.ceil(cans)} cans of paint.")

test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(test_h, test_w, coverage)
```

# Exercise 2 - Prime Numbers
- Instructions:<br>
You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.<br>
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

- Input:<br>
73

- Output:<br>
It's a prime number.

- Code:
```py
def prime_checker(number):
    is_prime = 1
    if number == 0 or number == 1:
        is_prime = 0

    for i in range(2, number):
        if number % i == 0:
            is_prime = 0
            break

    if is_prime == 1:
        print("It's a prime number.")
    elif is_prime == 0:
        print("It's not a prime number.")

n = int(input("Check this number: "))
prime_checker(n)
```
